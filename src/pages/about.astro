    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a designer and front-end developer based in the US. I specialize in creating digital products that balance
      aesthetic elegance with technical rigor. My work spans product design, interaction design, and full-stack web
      development.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past 5 years, I've worked with startups and established companies to build products used by millions.
      I've led design systems, mentored junior designers, and contributed to open-source projects focused on
      performance and accessibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I believe great design is invisible—it anticipates needs, removes friction, and delights through subtlety. I
      approach each project by understanding the problem deeply, prototyping rapidly, and iterating based on real user
      feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>Currently</h2>
    <p>
      I'm exploring the intersection of 3D web technologies, real-time data visualization, and performant frameworks
      like Astro and React. Outside of work, I enjoy writing about design, open-source development, and the future of
      the web.
